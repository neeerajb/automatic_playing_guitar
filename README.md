This project uses servo motor and solenoids to make the guitar auto-play ~~itself~~ only the C note lmao

## Notes

  - [Starter files for embedded systems](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/arm/)

## Task List

 1. Look into replacing `delay()` with timer functionalities â€” being worked on by Keegan
 
    Replaced with SysTick functionality for now

 2. Add interrupts for basic controls (start, stop, pause, speed up, speed down, etc.)
 
 3. ~~Add strumming capability~~ commented out?
 
 4. Decide on which solenoid combinations (notes) to play to be marked clearly in code
