## Notes

  - [Starter files for embedded systems](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/arm/)

## Task List

 1. Look into replacing `delay()` with timer functionalities â€” being worked on by Keegan
 
    Replaced with SysTick functionality for now

 2. Add interrupts for basic controls (start, stop, pause, speed up, speed down, etc.) worked on by Neeraj
    ~~switch 1: start and stop the code~~
    ~~switch 2: strumming time increase or decrease~~
 
 3. ~~Add strumming capability~~ 
 
 4. ~~Decide on which solenoid combinations (notes) to play to be marked clearly in code~~
